# Breast Cancer Prediction

Breast cancer is one of the diseases which has the highest mortality rates, it's mainly due to lack of early detection and proper treatment. With this model I hope to understand how much the results are influenced by the parameters such as mean radius, texture, area etc as well as check for false positives and false negatives, due to the where the organ is placed it makes it harder to detect and machines although boast a 95% accuracy we still can't be certain and that's why ML models like this help with. I have used confusion matrix to understand the errors that occur. 

Data:
It was collected from Kaggle, while they had solved it in Python I decided to do the same using my knowledge in R as well as the disease.  

To run the application: 
Open it in R studio and you will find a confusion matrix graph plotted to understand just by how much the errors can push the diagnosis to very different outcome.
